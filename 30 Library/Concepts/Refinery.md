# [[Refinery]]

A refinery is an industrial plant where [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] is processed and refined into more useful petroleum products. The primary purpose of a refinery is to convert crude oil, which in its raw form has limited end-use, into a range of products that are fit for market consumption. These products include gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt, heating oil, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and various chemicals used in the petrochemical industry.

### Main Purpose of a Refinery

The main purpose of a refinery can be summarized as follows:

1. **Separation**: When crude oil is processed at a refinery, it first goes through a separation process. This is usually done in a distillation unit where crude oil is heated and the different hydrocarbons are separated based on their boiling points. Lighter hydrocarbons like gases and gasoline vapors rise to the top of the distillation column, while heavier ones like diesel and lubricating oils collect lower down.

2. **Conversion**: After separation, heavier fractions of the oil are not always in demand in their raw form. Hence, various processes are used to convert these heavier fractions into more useful lighter products. Common conversion methods include cracking (breaking larger molecules into smaller ones), coking (breaking down heavy residues into lighter products and coke), and reforming (restructuring hydrocarbon molecules to increase the octane number of gasoline).

3. **Treatment**: The crude oil contains various impurities like sulfur, nitrogen, and metals that need to be removed. Treatment processes remove these impurities to meet the quality standards for finished products and to prevent pollution when these products are used.

4. **Blending**: The final step in the refinery process often involves blending different hydrocarbon streams to achieve specific product specifications. For example, blending is crucial to produce gasoline of different octane ratings or to meet seasonal variations in fuel performance requirements (like winter vs. summer gasoline).

Refineries are critical components in the energy supply chain, transforming crude oil into usable products that fuel vehicles, heat homes, and provide raw materials for plastics and other important products. Their operations are complex and require significant technological investment and expertise to manage the numerous chemical processes efficiently and safely.
