# [[Key Issue that led to the split between Sunni and Shia Islam]]

The key issue that led to the split between Sunni and Shia Islam was the question of **who should succeed the Prophet Muhammad**. The Sunnis believed that the caliph should be chosen based on his ability to lead the community, while the Shias believed that the caliph should be chosen based on his bloodline (i.e., he should be a descendant of the Prophet).
