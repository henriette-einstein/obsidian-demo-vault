# [[British Petroleum Corporation]]

The **British Petroleum Corporation**, commonly known as **BP**, is one of the world's leading oil and gas companies. Its origins date back to the early 20th century with the founding of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] in 1908, which was established following the discovery of oil in Iran. The company was primarily focused on extracting and refining oil in the Middle East, significantly impacting global energy supplies and geopolitical dynamics.

In 1954, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (as it was known after 1935) changed its name to the British Petroleum Company to reflect its expanding operations beyond Iran, especially in the aftermath of the nationalization of its Iranian assets in 1951 by [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]]'s government. This event led BP to diversify its operations globally.

BP has been involved in the exploration, production, refining, distribution, and marketing of oil and gas. Over the decades, it has grown through mergers and acquisitions, including significant ones like the acquisition of [[Amoco]] in 1998 and [[Atlantic Richfield]] (Arco) in 2000, which expanded its reach in the United States and enhanced its capabilities in oil and natural gas production.

Today, BP operates in dozens of countries worldwide, providing energy to millions of customers. It has also been moving towards renewable energy sources in response to climate change, investing in solar energy, wind power, and other sustainable technologies. BP's history includes periods of controversy, notably the 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon]] oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which has had lasting environmental and legal repercussions for the company.
