**William Knox D'Arcy** (1849â€“1917) was an important figure in the development of the oil industry in the Middle East, particularly in [[Iran]]. Originally from England, D'Arcy made his fortune in the gold mining industry in Australia before turning his interests to oil exploration at the turn of the 20th century.

In 1901, D'Arcy acquired a [[D'Arcy Concession|concession]] from the Shah of Iran to explore for oil across most of the country. This concession granted him exclusive rights to prospect for oil for 60 years. Despite facing numerous logistical, financial, and technical challenges, his determination led to the discovery of oil in 1908 in [[Masjed Soleyman]] in southwestern Iran. This landmark discovery was the first commercially significant find in the Middle East, and is the birth of the modern oil industry in the region.

The success of this venture led to the formation of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] in 1909, which later became [[BP|British Petroleum]] (BP). This company played a critical role in the global oil industry and was pivotal in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the 20th century.
