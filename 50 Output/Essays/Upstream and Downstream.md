# [[Upstream and Downstream]]

Operations in the oil industry are categorized into three major segments: upstream, midstream and downstream.

**Upstream operations**, also known as the exploration and production (E&P) segment, involve everything related to the exploration, drilling and production of oil and gas.

**Midstream operations** include the transportation, storage and wholesale marketing of crude or refined petroleum products. The activities are important to deliver the produced oil and gas to the refineries as well as to markets around the world.

**Downstream operations** include the refining of crude oil and purifying of raw natural gas as well as the sales and distribution of the products derived from the input materials.

The segments cover the complete lifecycle of oil and gas from its initial discovery to the final consumption.
