On May 28, 1901, Muzaffar al-Din, the Shah of Persia, granted [[William Knox D'Arcy]], a British-Australian businessman, exploration and drilling rights in Persia through the so-called [[D'Arcy Concession]]. In return, he received £20,000 in cash, £20,000 in shares and a promise of 16% of the profits from any oil production. The concession lasted for 60 years and covered three quarters of Persia's territory.

  
The petroleum engineer [[George Bernard Reynolds]] was hired to run the on-site operations. Reynolds started the exploration in northwestern Persia, but despite many attempts, he could not find any oil. After two unsuccessful years, D'Arcy ran into financial difficulties. He needed a bailout or otherwise would lose the concession. The British Admiralty, which was in competition with Russia for dominance in Persia, was concerned that the Russians would be granted the concession in the event of D'Arcy's bankruptcy. They put pressure on the [[Burmah Oil Company]] to save D'Arcy. Burmah was interested in a good relationship with the Admiralty and in 1905 established a Concession Syndicate with D'Arcy that saved the venture.

  
The drilling efforts in Persia continued to be unsuccessful, and a revolt of the Persian people in 1906 added new problems. Burmah Oil gradually lost its faith in the project and finally advised Reynold in a letter dated May 14, 1908, to stop his efforts and prepare to pack up. However, the letter did not arrive in Persia for several weeks and on May 25, 1908, Reynolds finally struck oil near [[Masjed Soleyman]].
