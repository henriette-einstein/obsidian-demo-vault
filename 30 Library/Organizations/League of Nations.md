The League of Nations was an international organization founded as a result of the [[Paris Peace Conference]] that ended the First World War. It was established on January 10, 1920, with the primary mission of maintaining world peace and preventing another global conflict. The League aimed to achieve this through collective security, disarmament, and settling international disputes via negotiation and arbitration.

Its foundational covenant was part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the peace treaty that formally ended World War I. The League's structure consisted of a General Assembly (where each member country had a vote), an Executive Council (with permanent and non-permanent members), and a permanent Secretariat. It also included various commissions and committees to address issues such as health, labor conditions, and the treatment of native populations in colonial territories.

Despite its ambitious goals, the League of Nations faced significant challenges and criticisms. It struggled with the absence of several key nations; the United States, for example, never joined despite President Woodrow Wilson being a driving force behind its creation. Additionally, it had limited powers to enforce its decisions, relying on the cooperation of its member states, which was not always forthcoming.

The League achieved some successes in the 1920s, including settling disputes between countries and overseeing mandates, but it was largely ineffective in preventing aggression by Axis powers in the 1930s. Its inability to stop the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935-1936) and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria (1931) were notable failures.

The outbreak of World War II in 1939 demonstrated the League's inability to fulfill its primary purpose of maintaining peace. It was officially dissolved on April 20, 1946, and its functions were transferred to the newly formed [[United Nations]], which aimed to avoid the shortcomings of the League and establish a more effective system for international peace and security.
