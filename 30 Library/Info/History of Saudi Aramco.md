# [[History of Saudi Aramco]]

**Saudi Aramco**, formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Company, is a giant in the global oil industry, with a history that traces back to the early 20th century. Its story is not only important to the development of [[Saudi Arabia]] but also to the evolution of global energy markets. Here's a detailed look at the company's history, including the discovery of oil and the key figures and partnerships involved.

## Early Beginnings and the Discovery of Oil

Saudi Aramco's origins date to the 1930s. Before oil was discovered, the Arabian Peninsula was largely overlooked in terms of oil potential. However, the success of oil exploration in nearby [[Bahrain]] indicated that there might be oil-rich fields in Saudi Arabia as well.

### Key Figures and Exploration

- **Charles R. Crane**: An American businessman who financed initial geological surveys in Saudi Arabia.
- **Max Steineke**: Chief geologist whose persistence and innovative methods were crucial in finding oil.

In 1933, the Saudi government granted an oil concession to [[Standard Oil of California]] (SOCAL, later [[Chevron]]), which created a subsidiary, [[California Arabian Standard Oil Company]] (CASOC) to handle the operations. This concession agreement was the result of negotiations between SOCAL representatives and Saudi officials, facilitated by the finance minister at the time, Abdullah Sulaiman.

## Major Discovery at Dammam

The turning point came with the discovery of oil in commercial quantities at the [[Dammam No. 7]] well in 1938, known as "Prosperity Well." This was after several years of exploratory drilling with little success. The discovery well was spearheaded by Max Steineke and his team, who decided to drill deeper than ever before, finally striking oil at approximately 1,440 meters depth.

## Expansion and World War II

The outbreak of World War II shortly after the discovery of oil slowed the development of oil fields. However, post-war, the demand for oil surged, and production at Aramco expanded rapidly. By the 1940s, Aramco was a key oil supplier for Allied forces.

## Partnerships with Other Oil Majors

Recognizing the need for more expertise and investment, in 1944, CASOC was renamed Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco). To expand its capabilities, Aramco began partnerships with several other major American oil companies:

- [[Texaco]] joined in 1936 through an oil sharing agreement.
- [[Exxon]] (then Standard Oil of New Jersey) and **Mobil** (then Socony-Vacuum Oil Company) joined in the 1940s, forming a consortium that would share profits and operational responsibilities.

These partnerships helped Aramco to develop infrastructure, such as pipelines and the Trans-Arabian Pipeline ([[Tapline]]), which was completed in 1950 to transport oil from Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean.

## Saudi Nationalization

The 1970s marked a significant shift for Aramco, as the Saudi government began a gradual process of nationalization:

- **1973**: The Saudi government acquired a 25% stake in Aramco.
- **1974**: The stake was increased to 60%.
- **1980**: The Saudi government completed the nationalization, acquiring 100% of Aramco and renaming it Saudi Arabian Oil Company, or Saudi Aramco.

## Expansion and Modern Developments

Post-nationalization, Saudi Aramco expanded beyond oil production into various sectors including refining, petrochemicals, and shipping. The company has been pivotal in modernizing the Saudi economy and remains a cornerstone of its strategic initiatives, including recent drives towards diversification and sustainability as part of the Saudi Vision 2030.

Saudi Aramco's history from its origins as a small exploration company to becoming the world's most valuable oil company reflects not only on its corporate evolution but also on the geopolitical shifts in global energy dynamics over the last century.
