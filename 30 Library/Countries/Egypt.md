## Historical Context

Egypt's history is one of the longest and most diverse of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE. Ancient Egypt was a cradle of civilization, pioneering developments in writing, agriculture, urbanization, and governance. Over millennia, Egypt saw the rise and fall of Pharaohs, Greek and Roman rule, Islamic conquests, and Ottoman control, leading to a complex cultural and political legacy.

### Modern Era

In the 20th century, Egypt underwent significant changes, from British colonialism to independence in 1922, followed by the revolution of 1952 which established a republic. The latter half of the century saw Egypt playing a central role in Middle Eastern politics, notably through the Arab-Israeli conflict and its peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Recent history has been marked by the 2011 revolution, part of the Arab Spring, leading to significant political changes.
