# [[Balfour Declaration]]

The Balfour Declaration of 1917 was a pivotal document in the history of the Middle East and the Jewish nationalist movement, known as Zionism. Issued on November 2, 1917, by British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour, it was addressed to Lord Walter Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland.

The declaration took the form of a short letter but had profound implications. It stated:

> "His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

The Balfour Declaration was significant because it was the first time a major world power recognized the aspirations of the Jewish people to establish a national home in Palestine, thus giving an important diplomatic boost to the Zionist movement. The declaration was incorporated into the terms of the British Mandate for Palestine, approved by the League of Nations in 1922, which tasked Britain with administering the region and paving the way for Jewish immigration and settlement.

The impact of the declaration was far-reaching, setting the stage for increased Jewish immigration to Palestine and heightening tensions with the Arab population. It remains a contentious document, celebrated by many Israelis as a foundational stone of modern Israel and viewed by many Palestinians and Arabs as a betrayal of their national aspirations.
