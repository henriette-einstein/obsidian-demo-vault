# Aqaba

Aqaba is Jordan's only coastal city, located at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea. Known for its warm water and rich marine life, it is a renowned diving destination and a vital commercial and tourism hub in the region.

## History

Aqaba has a history that dates back to prehistoric times, but it was first mentioned in historical texts around 1500 BC as a key stop on an ancient trade route. The city was known as Ayla during the Roman period, when it served as a crucial link in the chain of ports that facilitated trade along the Red Sea. Throughout the Byzantine era, Aqaba continued to be an important trading hub, connecting the Mediterranean world with Arabia and the East. It was later conquered by the Islamic armies in the 7th century and became a part of the Islamic Empire. Over the centuries, it was ruled by various powers, including the Crusaders, the Mamluks, and the Ottomans, who used it as a strategic garrison town.

### Modern Era

In the modern era, Aqaba's significance surged when it was incorporated into the newly established country of Jordan post World War I. The city gained further prominence during the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, facilitated by figures like [[Thomas Edward Lawrence]], known as Lawrence of Arabia. In the latter half of the 20th century, Aqaba was developed into a regional tourism and economic zone, with the establishment of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone in 2001, which transformed its economic landscape, boosting tourism and investment.
