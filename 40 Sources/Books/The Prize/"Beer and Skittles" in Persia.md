- At the end of the 18th century, the Qajar dynasty gained control over Persia
- In the 19th century the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Russia]] competed for dominance over Persia. They fought for influence primarily through concessions and loans
- On May 28, 1901, Shah [[Muzaffar al-Din]] signed the [[D'Arcy Concession]]. He received £20,000 in cash, £20,000 in shares and a promise of 16% of the profits from any oil production. In turn, [[William Knox D'Arcy|D'Arcy]] received a concession for 60 years that covered three quarters of Persia
- D'Arcy hired [[George Bernard Reynolds]] to run the operations in Persia. But the drilling efforts did not produce results.
- In 1903 D'Arcy got into financial struggles and needed a bailout. Otherwise, the concession would be lost.
- The British Admiralty put pressure on the [[Burmah Oil Company]] to save D'Arcy. They feared that the Russians would be granted a concession if D'Arcy went bankrupt. In 1905, Burmah Oil and D'Arcy established a Concession Syndicate that saved the venture.
- In 1906, a revolt broke out and the Shah's regime came to an end. 
- The drilling efforts were still unsuccessful and Burmah Oil, on May 14, 1908, advised Reynolds in a letter to stop his efforts and prepare to pack up. The letter did not arrive in Persia for several weeks. On May 25, 1908, Reynolds struck oil in [[Masjed Soleyman]].
-  On the 19th of April 1909, the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] went public and assumed the position of the Concession Syndicate in Persia
- A new refinery in [[Abadan Refinery|Abadan]] and a pipeline connecting it to the Masjed Soleyman oilfield were built. The refinery process began in summer 1912
- By the end of 1912, Anglo-Persian had exhausted its working capital. Millions of additional pounds were needed for further development. Without this money, the operation in Persia would come to a halt and the company might be swapped by Royal Dutch/Shell.
