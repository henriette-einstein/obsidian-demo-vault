# [[Timeline of the First Sikh War]]

The First Anglo-Sikh War was a significant conflict between the Sikh Empire, which was a major power in the northwest Indian subcontinent, and the East India Company (EIC), representing British colonial interests. This war marked a crucial period in the history of the Indian subcontinent, leading to the eventual annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British. Here is a timeline of the key events leading up to and during the First Anglo-Sikh War:

**1845**

- **December 11**: The First Anglo-Sikh War officially begins. Tensions between the Sikh Empire, under the regency of Maharani Jind Kaur, and the British East India Company had been escalating due to mutual distrust and provocations.

- **December 18**: Battle of  [Mudki](geo:30.7800562,74.8817217). The British, led by Sir Hugh Gough and Sir Henry Hardinge, face the Sikhs in the first major engagement of the war. Despite being outnumbered, the British manage to secure a victory, albeit with heavy casualties.

- **December 21-22**: Battle of  [Ferozeshah](geo:30.8794539,74.7876219). This battle is fought over two days, with the British initially struggling against the Sikh forces commanded by Lal Singh. The British forces are reinforced overnight, and on the second day, they manage to defeat the Sikhs, but again suffer significant losses.

**1846**
Sure, here it is formatted as requested:

- **January 28**: Battle of [Aliwal](geo:31.8918323,74.76801322204426). British forces under Sir Harry Smith engage and decisively defeat the Sikh forces led by Ranjodh Singh Majithia. This victory helps restore British confidence after the heavy losses suffered in the previous battles.

- **February 10**: Battle of [Sobraon](geo:31.1798362,74.8521709). This battle is the largest and the final conflict of the war. The Sikhs, led by Tej Singh, are decisively defeated by the British. The British victory at Sobraon effectively breaks the back of the Sikh army.

- **February 13**: Following their victory at Sobraon, British forces cross the Sutlej River and enter Punjab.

- **March 9**: The Treaty of Lahore is signed, officially ending the First Anglo-Sikh War. The treaty imposes harsh terms on the Sikhs, including the cession of significant territories to the British East India Company, a large indemnity, and the limitation of the Sikh army. The British also annex the Jalandhar Doab region.

- **March 11**: The Treaty of Bhyroval is signed, allowing for a British garrison to be stationed in Lahore. This treaty effectively places the Sikh Empire under British influence and sets the stage for further encroachments on Sikh sovereignty.
