## Introduction

Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, epitomizes a blend of traditional Arabian culture and modern luxury. This city is not only a political and administrative center but also a cultural and economic hub in the region. Renowned for its meticulously planned urban layout and striking contemporary architecture, Abu Dhabi has positioned itself as a key player in international affairs and as a global tourist destination.

## Historical Context

The area now known as Abu Dhabi was primarily a small pearl fishing village until oil was discovered in the 1950s. The revenue generated from oil exports has transformed it from a modest port town into a vibrant, wealthy metropolis. This transformation laid the groundwork for what would become one of the world’s most futuristic urban landscapes.

### Modern Era

Since becoming the capital of the newly formed United Arab Emirates in 1971, Abu Dhabi has experienced rapid development and diversification. Under the leadership of the Al Nahyan family, the city has invested heavily in health, education, and infrastructure, while also cultivating a cultural scene that includes the Louvre Abu Dhabi and plans for other major museum projects.
