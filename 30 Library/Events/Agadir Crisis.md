The Agadir Crisis, also known as the Second Moroccan Crisis, was a pivotal international incident in 1911 that brought Europe to the brink of war. The crisis illuminated the aggressive imperial ambitions and escalating tensions among major European powers, particularly between France and Germany, and its resolution laid the groundwork for alliances and conflicts that would eventually lead to [[World War I]].

## Background

The Agadir Crisis had its roots in the strategic and economic competition in Morocco, a region under the weakening control of the Sultan, where both France and Germany had significant interests. France aimed to establish a protectorate over Morocco, aligning with its broader imperial ambitions in North Africa. Germany, on the other hand, sought to challenge French influence and assert its own presence as a global imperial power.

The crisis was a direct sequel to the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905-1906, which had already seen Germany and France clash diplomatically over the control of Morocco. The resolution of that crisis had slightly favored French interests, but it left Germany disgruntled, seeking an opportunity to reassert its influence and gain territorial concessions.

## The Crisis

The immediate catalyst for the Agadir Crisis occurred in May 1911 when a rebellion broke out in Morocco against the [[Sultan]]. Using the unrest as a pretext to protect its citizens and economic interests, France sent troops to occupy Fez, the Moroccan capital. In response, on July 1, 1911, Germany dispatched the gunboat *SMS Panther* to the port of Agadir under the guise of protecting German nationals.

The arrival of the *Panther* was a clear challenge to French actions and was perceived as a threat by other major powers, including Britain. The choice of Agadir, a strategically significant Atlantic port, implied German ambitions to establish a naval base that could threaten British and French maritime routes.

## International Reactions and Resolution

The British, who had been alarmed by Germany's naval expansion and its potential threat to the British Empire, sided with France. The British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, made it clear that Britain would support France, intensifying the diplomatic standoff.

The crisis was ultimately resolved through negotiations that culminated in the [[Moroccoâ€“Congo Treaty|Treaty of Berlin]] in November 1911. France agreed to cede parts of French Equatorial Africa to Germany (the territories of Neukamerun), in exchange for Germany recognizing the French protectorate over Morocco. While this settlement resolved the immediate crisis, it exacerbated resentments, particularly in Germany, which felt cheated out of comparable colonial gains.

## Aftermath and Impact on World War I

The Agadir Crisis significantly shifted the balance of alliances in Europe. It solidified the Entente Cordiale between Britain and France, drawing them closer against a perceived common German threat. It also pushed France and Russia to strengthen their ties, wary of German ambitions. This network of alliances was a direct precursor to the alignment of powers during World War I.

Moreover, the crisis exposed the fragility of European diplomacy and the volatility of nationalist ambitions. It highlighted the dangers of militarism and alliance politics, which would play a crucial role in the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
