# [[Masjed Soleyman]]

Masjed Soleyman, located in the Khuzestan province of Iran, is significant as the site of the first oil discovery in the Middle East in 1908. This marked the beginning of large-scale oil production in the region and had profound implications for both the global oil market and geopolitical landscape of the 20th century.

## Overview

- **Name**: Masjed Soleyman
- **Country**: [[Iran]]
- **Capacity**: Capacity details are historical as the field's current operational status is limited
- **Ownership**: National Iranian Oil Company
- **Operational Status**: Mostly depleted, with limited ongoing extraction
- **Established**: 1908

## Historical Overview

The discovery of oil at Masjed Soleyman by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (now BP) transformed Iran into a major player in the global energy market. This event also set the stage for the country's later political and economic developments tied to its oil resources.

The significance of Masjed Soleyman to the oil industry stems from the events of 1908, when after several years of costly and challenging exploration, geologists working under the auspices of [[William Knox D'Arcy]] struck oil. This discovery was made on May 26, 1908, and it proved to be the first commercially viable oil well in the Middle East. 

The success at Masjed Soleyman led to the founding of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] in 1909, which later became [[British Petroleum Corporation]] (BP). This company was crucial in developing the oil fields and associated infrastructure which facilitated large-scale extraction and exportation of oil. The city became a hub of the oil industry, featuring extensive facilities including drilling sites, processing plants, and worker accommodations.

The oil produced in Masjed Soleyman and the broader region was instrumental during World War I, helping to fuel the British Navy, which had transitioned from coal to oil-powered vessels. This strategic shift not only emphasized the importance of oil in warfare but also marked the beginning of the global shift towards oil as a critical energy resource.

Important events in the history of the Masjed Soleyman oilfield include:
- **1908**: Discovery of oil, the first in the Middle East.
- **1913**: Start of commercial production, which prompted the construction of the Abadan Refinery, once the world's largest.
- **1951-1953**: Nationalization of the oil industry, which led to a brief closure during the Abadan Crisis.
- **1970s**: Decline in output as larger fields in the region were developed.
- **2000s-Present**: Efforts at revitalization and limited redevelopment, reflecting its diminished but ongoing role.
