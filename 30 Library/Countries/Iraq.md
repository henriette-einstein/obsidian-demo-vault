# [[Iraq]]

Iraq, located in the Middle East, is a country with a rich and complex history that dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, often referred to as the "cradle of civilization." This region is where some of the earliest known empires and cultures, including the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians, emerged and flourished. The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which run through the country, have been essential for agriculture and human habitation since ancient times.

## Historical Context

Iraq, known historically as Mesopotamia, is often cited as the "cradle of civilization," where the earliest cities, writing systems, and large-scale states emerged. Its strategic location, fertile lands, and access to vital waterways have made it a crossroads for trade, culture, and conflict throughout history. From the ancient Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians, to the more recent Ottoman Empire and British mandate, Iraq's history is rich and complex.

### Modern Era

The modern state of Iraq was established in 1920 under British mandate following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It gained independence in 1932. The discovery of oil in the early 20th century transformed Iraq's economy and made it a strategic asset in global politics. The Ba'ath Party's rise to power in 1968, followed by Saddam Hussein's presidency from 1979 to 2003, was marked by wars, including the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) and the Gulf War (1991). The 2003 US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein, leading to years of conflict and instability.
