## Introduction

Kuwait City, the capital and largest city of Kuwait, is a vibrant metropolis known for its modern architecture juxtaposed with old-world souks and Islamic heritage. It serves as the economic, cultural, and political hub of the country, holding significant influence in the Persian Gulf region. Its strategic location on the shores of the Persian Gulf has historically made it a central trading post, shaping its development and wealth in the petroleum-based economy.

## Historical Context

Kuwait City's origins trace back to the early 18th century when it was founded by tribes from the central Arabian Peninsula. Its significant geographical location along maritime trade routes facilitated its growth as a prosperous trading port by the 19th century. Historical events such as the signing of the Anglo-Kuwaiti Treaty of 1899 provided British protection, limiting Ottoman influence and later shaping its path towards independence declared on June 19, 1961.

### Modern Era

In the modern era, Kuwait City has faced significant challenges and developments. The discovery of oil in the 1930s transformed it into a wealthy state with rapid urbanization and modernization. The Iraqi invasion in 1990 led to severe destruction, but the city rebounded quickly post-liberation in 1991. Recent developments focus on diversifying the economy beyond oil, extensive urban planning, and increasing political participation through its parliamentary system.
