The significance of Masjed Soleyman to the oil industry stems from the events of 1908, when after several years of costly and challenging exploration, geologists working under the auspices of [[William Knox D'Arcy]] struck oil. This discovery was made on May 26, 1908, and it proved to be the first commercially viable oil well in the Middle East. 
The success at Masjed Soleyman led to the founding of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] in 1909, which later became [[British Petroleum Corporation]] (BP). This company was crucial in developing the oil fields and associated infrastructure which facilitated large-scale extraction and exportation of oil. The city became a hub of the oil industry, featuring extensive facilities including drilling sites, processing plants, and worker accommodations.

The oil produced in Masjed Soleyman and the broader region was instrumental during World War I, helping to fuel the British Navy, which had transitioned from coal to oil-powered vessels. This strategic shift not only emphasized the importance of oil in warfare but also marked the beginning of the global shift towards oil as a critical energy resource.
