# [[Ottoman Empire]]

The **Ottoman Empire** was a state that controlled much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries. It was established around the end of the 13th century in the region of Anatolia, in present-day [[Turkey]], following the decline of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm. The empire was founded by Osman I, from whom it derives its name (in Turkish, Osmanlı İmparatorluğu).

At its height, during the 16th and 17th centuries under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational, multilingual empire controlling much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. The empire was at the center of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries.

The Ottoman Empire was structured in a complex system of administration, with the [[Sultan]] at its apex as the absolute ruler. It had a sophisticated system of social organization, economic activities, and military might. The empire was known for its cultural richness, with significant contributions to art, science, religion, and architecture. The Ottomans were instrumental in the spread of [[Islam]] in the regions they controlled, and they also facilitated the exchange of goods and knowledge between the East and West through their strategic control of trade routes.

The decline of the Ottoman Empire began in the late 17th century when it started to lose significant territories in wars with European powers. The empire underwent a series of transformations in an attempt to modernize and compete with Western powers but faced internal and external challenges. The 19th century saw the empire's further decline, culminating in its defeat in World War I. Following the war, the empire was dismantled, and in 1922, the Republic of Turkey was established, marking the end of the Ottoman Empire.

The legacy of the Ottoman Empire is still evident today in the culture, legal systems, and political boundaries of many countries in Southeast Europe and the Middle East.
