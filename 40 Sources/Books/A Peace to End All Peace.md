## Summary

"Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East" by David Fromkin is a historical analysis that focuses on the period from 1914 to 1922, examining the decisions made by the Allies during and after World War I that led to the partitioning of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This transformation laid the foundational geopolitical landscape of the modern Middle East.

Fromkin argues that the decisions made by British, French, and other Allied leaders dismantled the Ottoman Empire and set the stage for continual conflicts within the region. He explores key events such as the secret [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], which divided the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire outside the Arabian Peninsula into areas of future British and French control or influence. The book also discusses the [[Balfour Declaration]], which promised a Jewish homeland in Palestine, further complicating regional dynamics.

The title of the book suggests that the peace treaties that concluded World War I (most notably the Treaty of Versailles) were not effective in stabilizing the region but rather in setting it on a path of turmoil and conflict. "A Peace to End All Peace" illuminates how the artificial borders drawn by these treaties ignored ethnic, tribal, and religious distinctions, leading to lasting tensions and violence.
