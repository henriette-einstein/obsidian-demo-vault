# [[Types of Crude Oil]]

[[Crude Oil]] is classified into various grades based on its specific gravity (density) and sulfur content. Two key classifications are:

- **Light vs. Heavy Crude Oil**: Light crude oil has a higher proportion of smaller molecules and flows more freely at room temperature. It contains a higher percentage of light hydrocarbons and gasoline, making it easier and cheaper to refine. Heavy crude oil is denser, contains more heavy molecules and residues after refining, and is harder to extract and process.
    
- **Sweet vs. Sour Crude Oil**: Sweet crude oil contains less sulfur and is preferred because it requires less processing to remove impurities. Sour crude oil has a higher sulfur content and requires more extensive refining to meet fuel standards and reduce sulfur emissions when burned.
