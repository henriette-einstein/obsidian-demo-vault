## Historical Context

Iran's history is marked by a series of dynastic changes, from the Medes and Persians in ancient times through the Islamic conquest in the 7th century, which introduced Islam to the region. The Safavid dynasty (1501–1736) established Twelver Shiism as the state religion, shaping Iran's identity distinct from its Sunni neighbors.

### Modern Era

The 20th century was a period of significant change for Iran, beginning with the Constitutional Revolution in the early 1900s, which sought to reduce royal authority and introduce democracy. The discovery of oil in 1908 led to foreign interest and influence in Iran's economy and politics. The 1979 Islamic Revolution transformed Iran from a monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to an Islamic republic under Ayatollah Khomeini, significantly impacting its domestic policies and international relations.
