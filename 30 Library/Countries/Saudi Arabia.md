## Historical Context

Saudi Arabia's history is deeply intertwined with Islam; it is the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad and the cradle of Islam. The modern state of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, who unified the four regions into a single nation through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud.

### Modern Era

The discovery of oil in 1938 transformed Saudi Arabia from a desert kingdom into one of the world's wealthiest nations, fundamentally altering its economic and political landscape. The country has since become the world's largest oil producer and exporter, controlling the world's second-largest oil reserves and the sixth-largest gas reserves.
