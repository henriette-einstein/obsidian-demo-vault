# [[George Bernard Reynolds]]

**George Bernhard Reynolds** was an influential British petroleum engineer and oil industry pioneer, best known for his pioneering role in the development of the oil industry in the Middle East. Born in the 19th century, Reynolds was initially engaged by [[William Knox D'Arcy]] to prospect for oil in [[Iran]], which was then part of the Persian Empire.

Reynolds faced numerous challenges, including difficult terrain and political instability, but his perseverance paid off. In 1908, he successfully discovered oil in [[Masjed Soleyman]] in southwestern Iran. This monumental find marked the first major oil discovery in the Middle East and led to the establishment of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], which eventually became [[British Petroleum Corporation]] (BP).

Reynolds's methods and dedication not only helped to establish the foundations of the modern oil industry in that region, but also significantly impacted the global energy market. His work underscored the strategic importance of Middle Eastern oil and reshaped geopolitical relations in the 20th century.
