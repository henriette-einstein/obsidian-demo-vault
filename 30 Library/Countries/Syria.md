## Historical Context

Syria's history is rich and complex, featuring some of the oldest civilizations in the world. It has been a crossroads of empires, from the Akkadians, Egyptians, Hittites, and Assyrians, to the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. Islamic Arab conquests in the 7th century brought significant cultural and religious changes. Over centuries, Syria was part of the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, followed by Ottoman rule from the 16th century until the end of World War I.

### Modern Era

Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Syria came under French mandate until its independence in 1946. The post-independence era was marked by political instability, coups, and brief union with Egypt. The Ba'ath Party has been in power since 1963, leading to the Assad family's long rule. The 2011 uprising against Bashar al-Assad's regime escalated into a civil war, causing widespread devastation and a significant refugee crisis.
