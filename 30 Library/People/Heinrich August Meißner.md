# [[Heinrich August Meißner]]

Heinrich August Meißner was a prominent German engineer and railway builder, born on January 3, 1862, in Leipzig, and died on January 14, 1940, in Istanbul. After studying civil engineering at the Technical University of Dresden, he moved to the Ottoman Empire in 1887, where he worked on several major railway projects. 

His notable works include the Anatolian Railway (İzmit–Ankara), the Saloniki–Monastir line, and the Hejaz Railway (Damascus–Medina), which was crucial for facilitating pilgrimages to Mecca. 

Meißner earned the title "Pasha" in 1904 for his contributions and received the Mecidiye Order. He also played a significant role in the construction of the Baghdad Railway, a strategic project funded by Germany. During World War I, he assisted in building the Ottoman military railway network in Palestine.

After the war, Meißner briefly returned to Germany but was invited back to Turkey by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1924 to continue his work. He later taught at Istanbul Technical University. Meißner's efforts significantly modernized the Ottoman transportation infrastructure, leaving a lasting legacy in the region. He was buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Feriköy, Istanbul.
