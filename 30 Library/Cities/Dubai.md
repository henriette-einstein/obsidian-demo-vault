## Introduction

Dubai is a city of superlatives, known for its skyscrapers, luxury shopping, and ambitious futuristic projects like artificial islands and the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. It is a global city and business hub of the Middle East, heavily reliant on tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. Dubai's ability to attract foreign investors and businesses has made it one of the most cosmopolitan and vibrant cities in the world.

## Historical Context

The settlement of Dubai was established in the 18th century as a small fishing village. It was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, primarily Indians during the 19th century, who settled in the city. The discovery of oil in 1966 transformed the city, but unlike other oil-rich cities, Dubai diversified early from oil reliance to a service-based, tourism-oriented economy.

### Modern Era

Since the 1970s, Dubai has seen unprecedented growth, evolving from a quiet port town into a dynamic metropolis. Key projects like the creation of the Jebel Ali Free Zone in 1985 catalyzed growth by attracting foreign companies with its favorable business regulations. The city's economy further boomed in the 2000s with the development of mega-projects like Palm Jumeirah and Dubai Marina.
