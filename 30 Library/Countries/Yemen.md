## Historical Context

Yemen's history is marked by ancient prosperity due to the incense trade, followed by periods of foreign domination and internal dynastic struggles. The country was divided into North Yemen and South Yemen for much of the 20th century, each following different political paths, with North Yemen becoming a republic in 1962 and South Yemen embracing socialism in 1967. The two Yemeni states were unified in 1990, but the country has since been plagued by conflict and political instability.

### Modern Era

The discovery of oil in the 1980s provided a temporary boost to Yemen's economy but also led to internal and external political challenges over resource control. The 21st century has seen Yemen caught in a complex web of conflict, involving internal divisions between the Houthi movement and the internationally recognized government, as well as regional interventions led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

## Important Events

- **Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi**: The current President of Yemen, recognized internationally but with limited control within the country due to the ongoing conflict.

## Oil Industry Overview

### History of Oil Discovery and Development

- **First Discovery**: Oil was first discovered in commercial quantities in the central Marib-Jawf basin in the 1980s.
- **Major Oil Fields**: Marib, Masila, and Shabwa are among the most significant oil-producing areas.
- **Production Statistics**:
  - **Oil Production**: Production has significantly declined from a peak in the early 2000s, currently estimated at around 100,000 barrels per day due to conflict and infrastructure challenges.
  - **Gas Production**: Yemen also has natural gas reserves, with the Balhaf LNG plant representing a significant investment, though its operations have been affected by the conflict.
- **Impact on Economy**: Oil revenues were a major source of government income and foreign exchange before the conflict, but the sector has been severely disrupted.

### Key Players

- **National Oil Companies**: Yemen's oil and gas sector is overseen by the Yemen Oil and Gas Corporation (YOGC) and its subsidiaries.
- **International Oil Companies in the Region**: Several international oil companies have operated in Yemen, though many have suspended operations due to the ongoing conflict.

## Geopolitical Influence

- **Regional Politics**: Yemen's strategic location by the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, a key maritime chokepoint, adds to its geopolitical significance.
- **International Relationships**: The conflict in Yemen has drawn in regional and international powers, complicating efforts to find a peaceful resolution.

## Current Challenges

Yemen faces profound challenges, including the devastating impact of the ongoing conflict on its population, infrastructure, and economy. The oil industry, once a pillar of the economy, is now a shadow of its former self, with recovery and development hindered by instability and lack of investment.
