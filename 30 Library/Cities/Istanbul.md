# Istanbul

Istanbul, straddling the Bosporus strait between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, serves as a physical and cultural bridge between Europe and Asia. Its unique position has endowed the city with a rich, layered history, making it one of the world's most fascinating cities.

## History

Originally founded as Byzantium by Greek colonists in 657 BC, Istanbul has been at the crossroads of civilizations for millennia. After being reestablished as Constantinople in 330 AD by Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, it became the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The city flourished as a center of Roman, and later, Christian culture. Over the centuries, it endured sieges and was prized for its strategic and commercial significance. The crowning glory of its Byzantine era, the Hagia Sophia, was constructed under Emperor Justinian in the 6th century.

### Modern Era

In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks under Sultan Mehmed II, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire and the beginning of the city's transformation into Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Istanbul underwent significant cultural and architectural development during the Ottoman period, including the construction of iconic structures such as the Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque. In the 19th century, the city modernized under various sultans, integrating Western architectural styles. Following the end of World War I and the subsequent establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, Ankara became the capital, but Istanbul continued to grow in importance and population.
