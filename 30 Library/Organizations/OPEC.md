The **Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries** (OPEC) is an intergovernmental organization founded in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], on September 14, 1960, by five founding members: [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Venezuela]]. It was established to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets to secure an efficient, economic, and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry.

OPEC's membership has expanded and contracted over the years and includes several of the world's largest oil-producing nations. Currently OPEC has 13 member countries, primarily located in the Middle East, Africa, and South America. These countries collectively hold a significant portion of the world's oil reserves and have a major influence on global oil prices by setting production targets.

OPEC's decisions can have a profound impact on the global economy. When OPEC countries decide to reduce oil production, it can lead to higher oil prices worldwide, affecting everything from the cost of gasoline to the expenses associated with manufacturing goods. Conversely, increasing oil production can lead to lower prices.

Over the years, OPEC has faced various challenges, including internal conflicts among member states, competition from non-OPEC oil producers, and global efforts to transition to renewable energy sources. Despite these challenges, OPEC remains a powerful entity in the global energy market, capable of influencing international oil prices and thereby affecting economies around the world.
