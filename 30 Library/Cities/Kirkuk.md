## Introduction

Kirkuk, a city with a complex tapestry of cultural and ethnic backgrounds, is situated in northern Iraq. Known for its vast oil reserves, Kirkuk has been a focal point of contention among various ethnic groups, making it a significant city in Iraq’s socio-political landscape. Its history spans several millennia, with influences from the Assyrians, Kurds, Turkmen, Arabs, and others, which have all left their mark on the city’s culture and architecture.

## Historical Context

The region around Kirkuk has been settled since at least the 3rd millennium BCE, originally under the name Arrapha. It has been a part of major empires including the Assyrian, Median, and Ottoman Empires. The discovery of oil in the early 20th century transformed Kirkuk into an industrial and economic hub but also instigated ethnic strife and territorial disputes.

### Modern Era

In recent decades, Kirkuk's history has been particularly tumultuous. During Saddam Hussein's regime, the city was Arabized; many Kurds and Turkmen were displaced to consolidate Arab control over its oil resources. Post-2003, Kirkuk has seen intense ethnic conflicts and was briefly under ISIS control in 2014, although it was recaptured by Iraqi forces supported by Kurdish Peshmerga later that year.
