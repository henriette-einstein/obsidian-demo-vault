# [[League of Nations Mandates]]

The mandate system of the [[League of Nations]] was established after World War I to administer former territories of the Ottoman Empire, which were considered not yet ready to govern themselves in the aftermath of the war. These territories were divided among the victorious Allied powers under the supervision of the League. In the Middle East, several mandates were established, reflecting the colonial interests and geopolitical strategies of the time. The primary mandates in the Middle East were:

1. **Palestine Mandate**: Entrusted to Britain in 1920, this mandate included the territories of modern-day Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jordan. The [[Balfour Declaration]] of 1917, which was incorporated into the mandate's terms, supported the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine but also called for protecting the rights of the existing non-Jewish communities. This mandate laid the groundwork for the complex and ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

2. **Transjordan (later Jordan) Mandate**: Initially part of the Palestine Mandate, Transjordan became a separate entity under British control in 1921. It was granted independence in 1946, becoming the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

3. **Syrian Mandate**: France gained control over this mandate, which included modern-day Syria and Lebanon. The mandate was characterized by French efforts to divide and rule by separating Lebanon from Syria and further subdividing the regions into smaller, more manageable units. Syria gained independence in 1946, and Lebanon was recognized as an independent country in 1943.

4. **Iraqi Mandate**: Also under British control, this mandate covered the territory of modern-day [[Iraq]]. Britain faced significant resistance and uprisings from the local population, leading to the establishment of a kingdom under [[Faisal I]] of Iraq in 1921. Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932, though British influence remained significant until the monarchy was overthrown in 1958.

The mandate system, in theory, was intended to prepare these territories for self-governance and eventual independence. However, in practice, it often served the imperial interests of the mandate powers and sowed seeds of future conflicts, particularly through arbitrary borders and the imposition of foreign governance structures. The [[League of Nations Mandates]] in the Middle East have had a lasting impact on the region's political and social landscape.
