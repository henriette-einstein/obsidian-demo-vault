- Sir [[John Fisher]] became First Sea Lord in 1904 and held the office until 1910. He was convinced that oil fuel would revolutionize the naval strategy and wanted to convert the fleet from coal propulsion to oil.
- He wanted oil fields developed under British control and pressed the [[Burmah Oil Company]] to rescue [[William Knox D'Arcy|D'Arcy]] in 1904 and 1905.
- Fisher wished to expand the naval program and was initially rebuffed by [[Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. The [[Agadir Crisis]] (July-November 1911) instantaneously transformed their point of view.
- In 1911 Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty, the top civilian post for the Royal Navy. He started major naval programs to construct new navy ships that relied on oil instead of coal. 
- One problem remained: Britain had enough supply of coal but no oil. 
- When [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo Persian]] came into financial troubles by the end of 1912, Churchill feared that they would be taken over by Royal Dutch/Shell. Britain would then have to rely for oil supply on two companies (Royal Dutch/Shell and Standard Oil) that were not under British control.
- Even though Shell offered to provide a long-term contract for the Royal Navy, Churchill favored a direct investment into Anglo-Persian. On June 14, 1914, the British Parliament passed a bill to acquire 51% of Anglo-Persian and so Britain became an oil company.
