# Damascus

Damascus, the capital of Syria, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Situated in the southwestern part of the country, it is a city rich in history and culture, renowned for its ancient architecture and historical significance.

## History

Damascus has been a crucial cultural and trade center since antiquity, owing to its strategic location at the crossroads of Africa, Asia, and Europe. It was first mentioned in an Egyptian document dating back to 1500 BCE. The city was historically significant in the Bible, being referenced as a place of conversion for Saint Paul. Over the centuries, it was ruled by various empires, including the Arameans, Romans, Byzantines, and the Umayyads. Under Roman rule, the city saw significant infrastructure developments. It reached a cultural zenith during the Umayyad Caliphate, serving as the capital from 661 to 750 CE, a period during which the Great Mosque of Damascus was constructed.

### Modern Era

In the modern era, Damascus remained a nexus of cultural and political activity. It was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1516 until the empire's dissolution after World War I, when it briefly became the capital of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920. Subsequently, it fell under French mandate until Syria’s independence in 1946. In recent decades, Damascus has been at the center of numerous political upheavals, including the ongoing Syrian civil war which has impacted the city profoundly, leading to significant damage and humanitarian challenges.
