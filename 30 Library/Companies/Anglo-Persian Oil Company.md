# [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]]

The **Anglo-Persian Oil Company** (APOC) was a British company founded in 1908 following the discovery of a large oil field in [[Masjed Soleyman]], Iran, by [[George Bernard Reynolds]], who was working under the financial backing of [[William Knox D'Arcy]]. This discovery marked the first major oil development in the Middle East, transforming the regional and global energy landscape.

APOC was initially established as a subsidiary of [[Burmah Oil Company]] and later became known as the [[British Petroleum Corporation]], or BP, one of today's oil and gas "supermajors." The creation of APOC signified a significant shift in global energy production, emphasizing the importance of Middle Eastern oil. The company played a crucial role during the early 20th century, especially in the period surrounding World War I, as it supplied the Royal Navy with fuel, aiding in the [[Transition from coal-powered to oil-fired ships in the British Navy|transition from coal-powered to oil-fired ships]].

The influence of APOC extended beyond just economic aspects; it had profound geopolitical implications, affecting British and Western interests in the Middle East for many decades. The company's operations led to significant infrastructure development in the region, including the construction of pipelines and refineries, but also sparked controversies and conflicts over oil revenues and sovereignty, which continue to resonate in international relations and economic policy in the region.
