# [[Extraction and Use of Crude Oil]]

[[Crude Oil]] is extracted from the earth through drilling, both on land and offshore. Once extracted, it is transported to [[Refinery|refineries]] where it is processed into various forms of energy and chemical products. The primary products derived from crude oil include:

- **Fuels**: Such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, and kerosene.
- **Petrochemicals**: Used to make products like plastics, fertilizers, solvents, and other chemicals.
