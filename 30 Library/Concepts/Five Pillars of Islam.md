# [[Five Pillars of Islam]]

The **Five Pillars of Islam** are the foundation of [[Muslim]] life:

1. **Shahada (Faith)**: The declaration of faith, stating that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. This proclamation confirms one's entry into the fold of Islam.

2. **Salat (Prayer)**: Muslims perform five obligatory prayers each day. These prayers are a direct link between the worshiper and Allah. There are specific times during the day when these prayers must be performed.

3. **Zakat (Almsgiving)**: This is a system of almsgiving to the needy and is considered a type of worship and of self-purification. Zakat is not charitable contributions given out of kindness or generosity but a mandatory process for Muslims in accordance with Islamic law.

4. **Sawm (Fasting during Ramadan)**: Muslims fast during the month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, from dawn until sunset. Fasting (sawm) is seen as a way to cleanse the soul and have empathy for those in the world that are hungry and less fortunate.

5. **Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca)**: Muslims who are physically and financially able to make the pilgrimage to Mecca are required to do so at least once in their lifetime. The Hajj is seen as a chance to wipe clean past sins and start fresh according to Allah.
