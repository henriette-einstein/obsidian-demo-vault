# [[D'Arcy Concession]]

The D'Arcy Concession was an important agreement in the history of the oil industry, granting significant exploration and drilling rights in Iran to [[William Knox D'Arcy]], an English financier and one of the early pioneers in oil exploration. Signed in 1901, the concession marked the beginning of large-scale oil exploitation in the Middle East and laid the groundwork for the region's future as a pivotal player in the global energy sector.

## Origins and Terms

In the late 19th century, Iran, then known as Persia, was under the rule of the Qajar dynasty and grappling with financial difficulties. Seeking to capitalize on potential natural resources, the Persian government was open to foreign investment and expertise. D'Arcy, who had made his fortune in the Australian gold mines, was looking for new ventures and was intrigued by the potential of finding oil in Persia.

The concession granted to D'Arcy covered a vast area of about 480,000 square miles—nearly the entire extent of Persia at the time, excluding the five northern provinces. The terms of the agreement included exclusive rights to prospect, explore, and develop oil resources in this area for 60 years. In return, D'Arcy agreed to pay £30,000 in cash, £30,000 in shares, an annual rental of £3,000, and a promise of 16% of the profits from any oil production to the Persian government.

## Challenges and Discovery

The search for oil was fraught with difficulties, including harsh terrain, logistical challenges, and political instability. D'Arcy spent significant amounts of his own wealth on the exploration efforts, which for many years seemed fruitless and pushed him near to bankruptcy. However, perseverance paid off when, in 1908, after seven years of exhaustive search, oil was finally discovered at [[Masjed Soleyman]] in southwestern Iran. This discovery was the first major oil find in the Middle East and is often considered the birth of the modern oil industry in that region.

## Impact and Legacy

The discovery of oil led to the establishment of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] in 1909, which would later become [[British Petroleum Corporation]] (BP). This company was instrumental in developing the oil fields and building infrastructure, including pipelines, refineries, and transport facilities, which facilitated the export of oil, primarily for use by the British Navy.

The D'Arcy Concession had profound implications for both Iran and the global energy market. Economically, it marked the beginning of petroleum revenue for Iran, though the terms of the concession were heavily skewed in favor of British interests, contributing to significant political and social unrest. The concession was also a cornerstone in the geopolitics of the 20th century, influencing the strategic importance of the Middle East due to its vast oil reserves.

In 1933, the concession was renegotiated and significantly altered under pressure from the Iranian government, which sought a better deal from the oil companies that had grown wealthy from Iranian oil. This renegotiation marked the start of a long history of Iran's struggle to control its own natural resources, a theme central to its nationalistic movements in the decades that followed.

The D'Arcy Concession is a crucial chapter in the history of the oil industry, representing both the immense potentials of energy exploration and the complex legacies of colonial economic arrangements.
