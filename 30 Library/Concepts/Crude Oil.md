# [[Crude Oil]]

Crude oil, often referred to simply as "oil," is a naturally occurring, unrefined petroleum product composed of hydrocarbon deposits and other organic materials. It is a fossil fuel, meaning it comes from the remains of ancient marine organisms such as plankton and algae that have been buried under layers of sediment and rock for millions of years.

Crude oil is primarily made up of hydrocarbons, which are molecules consisting of hydrogen and carbon atoms. These hydrocarbons come in various forms, including:

- **Alkanes (paraffins)**: Saturated hydrocarbons that can be either straight chains or branched chains.
- **Cycloalkanes (naphthenes)**: Saturated hydrocarbons with carbon atoms arranged in rings.
- **Aromatic hydrocarbons**: Unsaturated hydrocarbons containing one or more benzene rings.

Besides these hydrocarbons, crude oil can contain small amounts of other elements such as sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, and metals like vanadium and nickel. The presence and concentration of these elements can significantly affect the quality and refining process of the oil.
