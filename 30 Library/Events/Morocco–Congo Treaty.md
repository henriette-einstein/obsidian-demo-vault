# [[Morocco–Congo Treaty]]

The Morocco-Congo Treaty, signed on November 4, 1911, in Berlin, ended the [[Agadir Crisis]]. In fact, it was a combination of two German-French agreements, the first concerning Morocco (Morocco Treaty, Morocco Agreement), and the second concerning the Congo (Congo Agreement).  
  
With the treaty, the German Empire acknowledged France's dominance over Morocco and agreed to give up its own territorial claims in the region. In return, France turned over parts of French Equatorial Africa, known as Neukamerun, to the German Empire. A smaller area in the northeast of Cameroon, also called the Duck's Bill, was transferred to France. This increased the area of ​​the former German Cameroon by 275,000 square kilometers.
