## Introduction

Riyadh, the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia, is a sprawling metropolis symbolizing political power, financial wealth, and architectural ambition. Once a small oasis town, it has transformed into a vibrant city center, hosting ministries, embassies, and corporate headquarters. Riyadh is key to understanding Saudi Arabia’s evolution and its increasing global influence, especially in the realms of finance and politics.

## Historical Context

Historically a small, walled city, Riyadh's roots trace back to the 15th century as a mud-brick way station along desert trading routes. The city was captured by the Saudi dynasty in 1902, an event that marked the beginning of the kingdom's consolidation that would culminate in the establishment of Saudi Arabia in 1932. This event set the stage for Riyadh’s ascendancy to the capital of the country, replacing the more coastal Jeddah.

### Modern Era

In the post-oil discovery era from the mid-20th century, Riyadh has been at the forefront of Saudi Arabia's dramatic economic and social transformations. Urbanization, spurred by vast oil revenues, saw the city's population swell, and its infrastructure expand. The city's modern skyline, characterized by the iconic Kingdom Centre, is a testament to its rapid development and Saudi Arabia’s ambitions on the world stage.
