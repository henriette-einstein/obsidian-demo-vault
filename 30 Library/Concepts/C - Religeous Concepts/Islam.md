# [[Islam]]

Islam is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion that is based on the belief in one God ([[Allah]] in Arabic) and the teachings of [[Muhammad]] as the last prophet of God. It is the second-largest religion in the world, with over a billion followers, known as [[Muslim|Muslims]]. The word "Islam" itself means "submission" in Arabic, reflecting the religion's core principle of submitting to the will of Allah.

Islam's foundational beliefs are encapsulated in the [[Five Pillars of Islam|Five Pillars]], which are obligatory acts of worship that define a Muslim's faith and practice.

According to Islam, the divine will is expressed in the [[Quran]] and in the [[Sunnah]]. The **Quran** is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of God as revealed to Muhammad. It is written in Arabic and divided into chapters called [[Surah|surahs]]. The teachings of the Quran cover all aspects of life, including matters of doctrine, social organization, and legislation. The **Sunnah** refers to the traditions and practices of the Prophet Muhammad, which, alongside the Quran, provide a model for how Muslims should live their lives.

The two major sects of Islam are [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]]. Sunni Muslims are the majority, and they emphasize the authority of the written Quran and Hadith. Shia Muslims, on the other hand, also value the teachings of Muhammad's family and descendants. Despite these differences, Sunni and Shia Muslims share the core beliefs and practices of Islam.
