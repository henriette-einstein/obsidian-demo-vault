# [[Muslim]]

A Muslim is an adherent of [[Islam]] and the teachings and normative example (called the [[Sunnah]], composed of accounts called [[Hadith]]) of Muhammad, who is considered the last prophet of God in Islam. The followers of Islam aim to live a life of complete submission to Allah. They express their faith through the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], which are the foundation of Muslim life.

Muslims also follow a moral framework that touches on virtually every aspect of life, from family and social issues to ethics and politics. Their practice is based on the Quran and Hadith, as well as schools of Islamic jurisprudence for interpreting them. The diversity within the Muslim community in terms of race, ethnicity, language, and nationality is vast, with Islam being the second-largest religion in the world.
